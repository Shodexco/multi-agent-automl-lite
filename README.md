# 🧠 Multi-Agent AutoML Pipeline (Lite Version)

## 🔥 Overview
This is the **Lite Version** of my Multi-Agent AutoML Pipeline—an AI-powered system designed to automate the machine learning lifecycle. Using modular AI agents, the pipeline streamlines the following tasks:

- Dataset analysis
- Task type detection (Regression / Classification)
- Model selection from pre-defined algorithms
- Model training and evaluation

This project demonstrates the power of multi-agent orchestration in machine learning automation.
